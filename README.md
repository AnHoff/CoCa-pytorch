## CoCa - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01917">CoCa, Contrastive Captioners are Image-Text Foundation Models</a>, in Pytorch. They were able to elegantly fit in contrastive learning to a conventional encoder / decoder  (image to text) transformer, achieving SOTA 91.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a finetuned encoder.
